# Evaluates2-Phone-Interview-Prep
Advice and links for conducting phone interviews with potential Evaluates2 candidates.


## Part 0 - Interview Prep

- Load up coderpad or repl.io beforehand. Wait to actually create it until you ask which language the candidate would like to use.

- Look through the candidate's code. Look good signs like readable code, automated tests, organized file and folder organization, nicely readable markdown README files, etc. If you can find something about the candidate's code that can be improved try to work this into the conversation when going deeper into his or her skills so that you can gauge how they receive constructive criticism. It's also just a better experience for the candidate- since you can't give everyone the job it's nice to at least give everyone some piece of advice that will make them an even better engineer going forward.

- Be sure to call the candidate on time, but not early. Definitely not late!

- If you cannot make the call be sure to cancel and start the rescheduling process as soon as possible.


## Part 1 - Initial Chat

1. "Tell me about yourself". Let the candidate open up the discussion and tell you what he or she wants to talk about and highlight.

2. Go deeper into the candidates experiences and current skills. 

3. Explain a bit about the position and particular project (if allowed to discuss it).

4. Ask if the candidate has any questions about the role and if so, let the candidate ask them and answer them the best you can.

## Part 2 - Code Challenge

After the code chat, ask the candidate what programming language he or she would like to use and create either a codepad.io or a repl.io link with that language.

- use "E2-Code-review-guidelines" to review the code.

- mention that you would prefer if the candidate solve the question in "TDD" style. 

- after the first code challenge, ask the candidate to do another one in a different programming language (can't be javascript or typescript)!
