# Evaluates2-Phone-Interview-Prep
Advice and links for conducting phone interviews with potential Evaluates2 candidates.


## Part 0 - Interview Prep

- Load up coderpad or repl.io beforehand. Wait to actually create it until you ask which language the candidate would like to use.
- Be sure to call the candidate on time, but not early.


## Part 1 - Initial Chat

1. "Tell me about yourself". Let the candidate open up the discussion and tell you what he or she wants to talk about and highlight.

2. Go deeper into the candidates experiences and current skills. 

3. Explain a bit about the position and particular project (if allowed to discuss it).

4. Ask if the candidate has any questions about the role and if so, let the candidate ask them and answer them the best you can.

## Part 2 - Code Challenge

After the code chat, ask the candidate what programming language he or she would like to use and create either a codepad.io or a repl.io link with that language.

- use "E2-Code-review-guidelines" to review the code.

- mention that you would prefer if the candidate solve the question in "TDD" style. 

- after the first code challenge, ask the candidate to do another one in a different programming language (can't be javascript and typescript)!
